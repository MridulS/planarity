#summary History of the Planarity Project

Early in my graduate studies (1996), I took a graph algorithms course from Wendy Myrvold, who later became my Ph.D. supervisor.  For my course project, I chose to study linear time planarity algorithms, which were widely regarded as being quite complex.  

The Lempel-Even-Cederbaum (LEC) planarity algorithm is a _vertex addition_ method that was optimized to linear time by the PQ-tree data structure created by Booth and Lueker. In a selected order, each vertex is added to a partial embedding, along with the edges incident to that new vertex and the vertices previously added to the partial embedding.
