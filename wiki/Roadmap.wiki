This page presents the roadmap for future development of this project.

== Version 2.x ==

  * 2.0: Planar Embedding and Kuratowski Subgraph Isolation (DONE)
  * 2.0: Outerplanar Embedding and Obstruction Isolation (DONE)
  * 2.0: Extensible Planarity-Related Algorithm Framework (DONE)
  * 2.0: Planar Graph Drawing by Visibility Representation (DONE)
  * 2.0: K23 subgraph homeomorphism (DONE)
  * 2.0: K33 subgraph homeomorphism (DONE)

  * 2.1: K4 subgraph homeomorphism (DONE)
  * 2.2: Vertex coloring by minimal degree selection, including linear time planar graph 5-coloring with the Matula-Shiloach-Tarjan-Frederickson optimization (DONE)

Other algorithms that may be formulated in the future could be supported as extensions, such as:
 
  * Maximal planar subgraph
  * K5 subgraph homeomorphism
  * Projective planarity

A fuller range of algorithm implementations may also be developed, such as

  * Directed graph methods, e.g. topological sort, 2SAT
  * Weighted graph methods, esp. Dijkstra's shortest path with my implementation of Tarjan's Fibonacci heap.
  * An O(log n) improvement to the Karger-Stein randomized min-cut method

== Version 2.x.y ==

Minor adjustments and tweaks that may be desired from time to time. This may include optimizations and service routines such as:

  * Edge contract and uncontract (DONE)
  * Identifying two vertices, i.e. merging two vertices (DONE)
  * Consolidated DFS and Lowpoint Preprocessing Optimization
  * Planar graph dual
  * BFS
  * Refinements to I/O routines

== Version 3.x ==

Major revisions to the graph library framework.  This may include changes needed to make more generic data structures and interface changes that may be needed to have consistency across multiple implementation languages such as C++ and Java.
