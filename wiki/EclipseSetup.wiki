= Introduction =

This page tells you how to set up Eclipse to work on this project.  Other environments can be used if desired, in which case analogous setup processes should be used.

These instructions are for Eclipse 3.4 (Ganymede) and the corresponding Subversive plugin for SVN support.  Command-line SVN can be used instead if desired.

Note: The Google Code Wiki system's numbered list feature does not work well on the IE browser.  This pages is best viewed with the Firefox browser.

  # *Install Eclipse C++ Development Environment*
    # Obtain the Eclipse IDE for C/C++ developers from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
    # Create a directory eclipse/zipfiles and put the download there
    # Unzip to eclipse/34-cpp-ganymede
    # Eclipse executable will be in the directory eclipse/34-cpp-ganymede/eclipse
    # Launch eclipse and create workspace in eclipse/workspaces-cpp
      * You're obviously free to adopt whatever directory structure you want, but this organization is suggested to allow your source code to be independent of installing future versions of eclipse.  If the next version follows the Jupiter moon naming convention, then you'd expand it into eclipse/35-cpp-callisto and then load projects from your workspaces-cpp area without having to move them.
    # Get the MinGW C/C++ compiler version 5.1.3 (MinGW-5.1.3.exe) and install to eclipse/cpp-mingw
    # Get the GDB debugger version 6.6 (gdb-6.6.zip) and unzip into eclipse/cpp-mingw/bin
  # *Install Subversive plugin* 
    # Either navigate to http://www.eclipse.org/subversive, click "Downloads" on left panel, click link to install instructions,
    # Or follow instructions below.
    # In Eclipse, choose menu Help | Software Updates
    # Click Available Software tab
    # Must install Subversive plugin
      * It's under the Ganymede Update Site (http://download.eclipse.org/release/ganymede)
      * Then, open up the Collaboration Tools
      * Choose the checkbox for Subversive SVN Team Provider (choose the incubation 0.7.3 release)
    # Before proceeding to install, must also install Subversive Connectors (incubation) as follows (all three do seem to need to be installed at the same time)
      * Click "Add Site..."
      * Add the external update site indicated on the Downloads site 
        * To find out the update site, click external site link (http://www.polarion.com/products/svn/subversive.php?src=eclipseproject)
        * Or, just use the following update site (the current one) http://www.polarion.org/projects/subversive/download/eclipse/2.0/update-site/
        * Click OK to add the site
      * Back on the Available Software tab, 
        * Open the Subversive SVN Connectors subtree
        * Choose the child Subversive SVN Connectors and SVNKit 1.1.7 (the latter is marked optional, but it isn't)
    # Go back to Ganymede Update Site | Collaboration Tools | Subversive SVN Team Provider and make sure it is still checked
        * Doing "Add site..." is sometimes unchecking that selection
    # Click Install...
  # *Environment set up*
    # Window | Preferences
    # Go to General | Editors | Text Editors
      * Set "Displayed Tab width: 4" and check "Insert spaces for tabs"
    # Go to Team | SVN | Properties Configuration
    # On the Automatic Properties tab, click Add button to add each of the following
