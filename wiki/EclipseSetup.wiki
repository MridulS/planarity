= Introduction =

This page tells you how to set up Eclipse to work on this project.  Other environments can be used if desired, in which case analogous setup processes should be used.

These instructions are for Eclipse 3.4 (Ganymede) and the corresponding Subversive plugin for SVN support.  Command-line SVN can be used instead if desired.

Note: The Google Code Wiki system's numbered list feature does not work well on the IE browser.  This pages is best viewed with the FireFox browser.
